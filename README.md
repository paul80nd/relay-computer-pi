# relay-computer-pi

This is a collection of .NET C# code routines supporting my YouTube series around calculating Pi on my Relay Computer.

The YouTube series can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcgfeRkKpMU&list=PLLACadYlrOkZKv9tdUgDgMFpGZncWS_6l) and more information generally on my relay computer can be found at my [blog](https://relaycomputer.co.uk).

## Building and running

You will need [the .NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). You can then run this program from the CLI as follows:

```console
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
